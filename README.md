Things to include:

- The filenames (e.g. "towns.geojson" vs. "towns.csv" don't necessarily always contain the same attribute information -- see file-notes.csv for file specifics)

- Data for this project is created in an [Equal Area Conic projection for Russia (8568)](https://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/albers-equal-area-russia/html/). The projection can be defined in a program like QGIS by [creating a custom coordinate reference system definition](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/20566/defining-new-custom-projections-in-qgis).
